# UPS Gem
This gem will allow you to create paid shipping labels and give you a base64 representation of the labels themselves.

## TODO

1. Finish ShipmentConfirmRequest with a decent way to build the requests since it requires a lot of information.
2. Add configuration options to ShipmentConfirmRequest such as PackagingType, PaymentInformation, etc.
3. Add AcceptShipmentRequest class to accept the information as well the returned request with the label information.

## Contributing

3. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
4. Create new Pull Request
